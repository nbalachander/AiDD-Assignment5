        The middle of the ocean is my favorite place in the world. There is
        something about it that captivates me. Whether it is the wind hitting my
        face, the sound of waves around me, or simply being far from land, I
        find a deep sense of calm near the water.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems
        through the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. My
        background in sailing, combined with my technical education, has helped
        me develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I’ve learned
        how to work with data, communicate clearly, and adapt quickly in
        changing environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it’s reading wind patterns on the water or drawing insights from
        complex datasets, I bring a thoughtful and strategic mindset to
        everything I do. I hope to apply these skills in a future role as a
        business analyst or consultant, where I can help organizations solve
        problems, make data-driven decisions, and deliver meaningful results.
