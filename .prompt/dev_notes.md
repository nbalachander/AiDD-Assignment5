AI Reflection

Working with GitHub Copilot and Cursor throughout this assignment has been very helpful for me. I intilaly used sode from assignments in undergrad to set up the intiial layout for te website, especially the navigation bar and colors cheme, but I used AI to help me make the website look more consistent and elegant. While most of the time Copilot provided clear, actionable suggestions for both design and functionality, I had to use Cursor to make changes to Copilot's suggestions to create a cohesive and visually appealing website. I appreciated how quickly I could iterate on ideas, from styling pages to implementing form validation and accessibility features. The prompt log made it easy to track changes and reflect on what worked well and what needed adjustment. I found Both ai's ability to generate modern layouts and responsive designs especially helpful, and the validation logic for the contact form was thorough and user-friendly. I occasionally needed to tweak outputs to better fit my preferences or assignment requirements myself but, the overall process was efficient and collaborative. This experience has shown me how AI can accelerate web development, improve code quality, and support creative problem-solving. I feel more confident in my ability to use AI tools for future projects.
